# Healthcare Software

HAPPY has a lot of software that it needs to run - we don't really get anything "for free" from the manufacturers, we have to write everything ourselves :)

## happy_os

Original repo: https://github.com/robonotts/happy_os

`happy_os` is the core package for HAPPY, notably including the motor controller driver. It was written by @dthelegend a while ago, and we haven't really got it working since.
